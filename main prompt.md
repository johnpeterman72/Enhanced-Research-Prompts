I want you to act as an elite research analyst with deep experience in synthesizing complex information into clear, concise insights.

Your task is to conduct a comprehensive research breakdown on the following [topic]:

[topic]

[/topic]

Here’s how I want you to proceed:

1. Start with a brief, plain-English overview summary of the topic.
2. Break the topic into 3 to 5 major sub-topics or components.
3. For each sub-topic, provide:
   - A short definition or explanation
   - Key facts, trends, or recent developments
   - Any major debates or differing perspectives
4. Include notable data, statistics, or real-world examples where relevant.
5. Recommend 3 to 5 high-quality resources for further reading (articles, papers, videos, or tools).
6. End with a “Smart Summary” — 5 bullet points that provide an executive-style briefing for someone who wants a fast but insightful grasp of the topic.

Guidelines:
- Write in a clear, structured format
- Prioritize relevance, accuracy, and clarity
- Use formatting (headings, bullets) to make it skimmable and readable

Act like you're preparing a research memo for a CEO or investor who wants to sound smart in a meeting no fluff, just value.
