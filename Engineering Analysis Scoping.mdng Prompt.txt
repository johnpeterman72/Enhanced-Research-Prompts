**Engineering Analysis Scoping Prompt**

Analyze this engineering domain as a technical analyst: [topic]

**Analytical Framework:**

1. **Market Position** - What problem space does this occupy? Who are the key players and stakeholders?

2. **Technical Architecture** - What are the core technical components and how do they interact? What are the critical dependencies?

3. **Performance Vectors** - What metrics matter most? Where are the current bottlenecks or limitations?

4. **Innovation Drivers** - What's pushing development forward? What constraints are shaping design decisions?

5. **Research Angles** - Based on the above, what are 3-4 specific analytical questions I should investigate?

**Deliver:**
- Technical assessment, not tutorial
- Focus on competitive advantages, technical debt, and scaling challenges  
- Highlight what's measurable vs. what's qualitative
- Flag areas where data might be scarce or proprietary

**Output goal:** Structured understanding that enables me to formulate targeted research hypotheses and identify the right technical sources to investigate.

Think McKinsey tech practice, not engineering textbook.
