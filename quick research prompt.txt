**Quick Deep Dive Research Prompt**

Help me dig deeper into this topic: [topic]

**Your approach:**
1. **What's the real story?** - Give me the essential context in 2-3 sentences
2. **Break it down** - What are the 3-4 key pieces I need to understand?
3. **Show me the tensions** - Where do people disagree? What's controversial or counterintuitive?
4. **Make it real** - Hit me with specific examples, recent developments, or surprising data
5. **Point me deeper** - What should I read/watch next if this hooks me?

**Keep it:**
- Conversational but smart
- Focused on "why this matters"
- Full of specifics, not fluff
- Honest about what's unclear or debated

Think of this as prepping me for a conversation where I want to ask thoughtful questions, not just repeat Wikipedia facts.
