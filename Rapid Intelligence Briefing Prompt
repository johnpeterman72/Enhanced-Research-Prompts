2. Rapid Intelligence Briefing Prompt
Use Case: Fast, focused research for informed conversations
Best For: Meeting prep, discussion facilitation, rapid learning
Give me a rapid intelligence briefing on: [topic]

**Intelligence Framework:**

1. **Current Reality Check** - What's actually happening right now? (Search recent developments for fast-moving topics)

2. **Core Architecture** - Break down the 3-4 essential components I need to understand

3. **Strategic Tensions** - Where are the meaningful disagreements, trade-offs, or unresolved challenges? (Not just "some people think X, others think Y" - what's at stake?)

4. **Reality Anchors** - Specific recent examples, concrete data points, or measurable outcomes that make this tangible

5. **Sharp Questions** - Give me 3-4 questions that would reveal someone actually understands this topic (questions that expose assumptions, reveal trade-offs, or probe deeper mechanisms)

**Quality Checks:**
- Flag when information is dated, uncertain, or conflicting
- Focus on "why this matters now" not historical background
- Include specific examples that happened in the last 1-2 years when possible
- Distinguish between hype/speculation and substantiated trends

**Tone:** Conversational but sharp - like briefing someone who needs to ask intelligent questions, not just repeat facts.
