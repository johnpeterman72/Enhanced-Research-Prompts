# Enhanced-Research-Prompts
Enhanced Research Prompts for Claude
# Research Prompts Collection

A curated set of prompts for different research scenarios, from quick exploration to comprehensive analysis.
## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of specialized AI prompt templates for research and analysis tasks. The project focuses on providing structured approaches to different types of research scenarios:

- [**main prompt.txt**](https://github.com/johnpeterman72/Enhanced-Research-Prompts/blob/main/main%20prompt.txt): General research analysis template for comprehensive topic breakdowns
- [**enhanced research prompt.txt**](https://github.com/johnpeterman72/Enhanced-Research-Prompts/blob/main/enhanced%20research%20prompt.txt): Advanced research protocol for strategic intelligence briefings
- [**Engineering Analysis Scoping Prompt.txt**](https://github.com/johnpeterman72/Enhanced-Research-Prompts/blob/main/Engineering%20Analysis%20Scoping%20Prompt.txt): Technical analysis framework for engineering domains
- [**Engineering Topic Explorer Prompt.txt**](https://github.com/johnpeterman72/Enhanced-Research-Prompts/blob/main/Engineering%20Topic%20Explorer%20Prompt.txt): Discovery-oriented template for exploring unfamiliar engineering topics
- [**quick research prompt.txt**](https://github.com/johnpeterman72/Enhanced-Research-Prompts/blob/main/quick%20research%20prompt.txt): Conversational deep-dive template for rapid topic exploration

## Architecture

The repository uses a flat file structure with each prompt template serving a specific research methodology:

1. **General Research**: Broad topic analysis with executive summary focus
2. **Enhanced Research**: Multi-phase analytical protocol with evidence standards
3. **Engineering Scoping**: Technical assessment framework for engineering domains
4. **Engineering Explorer**: Landscape mapping for unfamiliar technical topics
5. **Quick Research**: Rapid analysis for conversational preparation

## Working with Prompt Templates

When modifying or creating new prompt templates:

- Each template follows a structured format with clear phases or sections
- Templates include specific instructions for output formatting and quality standards
- Focus on analytical frameworks rather than generic research approaches
- Maintain consistent terminology: "topic" as the variable placeholder
- Include specific guidance on evidence standards and source requirements

## File Naming Convention

Templates use descriptive names ending in "prompt.txt" or "Prompt.txt" to clearly indicate their purpose and maintain consistency across the collection.

## ðŸŽ¯ Selection Guide

| Scenario | Recommended Prompt | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Need to sound smart in a C-suite meeting | Enhanced Research Analysis | Comprehensive, authoritative |
| Exploring a new topic casually | Quick Deep Dive | Conversational, accessible |
| Starting research on unfamiliar engineering topic | Engineering Topic Explorer | Maps unknowns, suggests questions |
| Technical competitive analysis | Engineering Analysis Scoping | Strategic, metrics-focused |

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Tips

1. **Replace `[topic]` with your specific research target**
2. **Modify depth requirements based on available time**
3. **Combine prompts for complex projects** (e.g., start with Explorer, then use Enhanced Analysis)
4. **Adjust formality based on your audience**

## ðŸ”„ Iteration Strategy

- Start broad â†’ narrow down
- Use Explorer prompts to generate better research questions
- Move from conversational to formal as understanding deepens
- Layer multiple prompt approaches for comprehensive coverage
