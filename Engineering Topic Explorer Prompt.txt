**Engineering Topic Explorer Prompt**

I'm exploring this engineering topic but don't know what I don't know: [topic]

**Help me map the landscape:**

1. **What am I looking at?** - Quick overview: what field, what problem does it solve, why does it exist?

2. **What are the main pieces?** - Break down the key components, systems, or concepts I should understand

3. **Where's the action?** - What's actively being developed, debated, or causing problems right now?

4. **What should I be curious about?** - Point out the interesting technical challenges, trade-offs, or unsolved problems

5. **What questions should I be asking?** - Give me 3-4 specific research questions that would help me understand this topic better

**Focus on:**
- Technical fundamentals I might be missing
- Current challenges or limitations
- Areas where there's active innovation
- Common misconceptions or knowledge gaps

Goal: Help me go from "I heard about X" to "I have smart questions about X" so I can do focused research next.
