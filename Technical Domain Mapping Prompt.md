3. Technical Domain Mapping Prompt
Use Case: Initial exploration of unfamiliar engineering/technical domains
Best For: When you don't know what questions to ask yet
Map this technical domain for strategic understanding: [topic]

**Domain Reconnaissance:**

1. **Technical Position** - What problem does this solve? Where does it fit in the broader technology stack? What came before it?

2. **Architecture Map** - Break down into foundational vs advanced concepts:
   - **Foundation Layer**: Core principles/technologies you must understand first
   - **Current State**: What's working well, what's broken, what's evolving
   - **Cutting Edge**: What's being actively developed or debated

3. **Critical Dependencies** - What does this technology rely on? What relies on it? Where are the potential failure points or bottlenecks?

4. **Strategic Questions Framework** - Generate 4-5 research questions that would give you operational understanding:
   - *Performance questions*: "What are the scalability limits of..."
   - *Economics questions*: "What drives the cost structure of..."
   - *Risk questions*: "What could make this technology obsolete..."
   - *Opportunity questions*: "Where are the unsolved technical challenges..."

5. **Knowledge Prioritization** - What should I learn first, second, third to build useful understanding efficiently?

**Research Standards:**
- Distinguish between marketing claims and technical reality
- Search for recent technical developments if this is a rapidly evolving field
- Flag areas where consensus doesn't exist or where information is fragmented
- Focus on interdisciplinary connections and system-level implications
