1. Strategic Intelligence Analysis Prompt
Use Case: Formal, comprehensive research for strategic decision-making
Best For: Board presentations, investment decisions, policy briefs
Conduct a strategic intelligence analysis on: [topic]

**Research Protocol:**

**Phase 1: Intelligence Baseline**
- Executive summary: Define the topic and current strategic significance (2-3 sentences)
- Search for latest developments if topic involves recent changes or current events
- Flag information confidence levels and any critical knowledge gaps

**Phase 2: Strategic Decomposition**
Break into 3-5 strategic dimensions, each with:
- **Core Definition**: Clear explanation with strategic context
- **Current State**: Latest quantifiable developments (include dates, specific metrics, sources)
- **Strategic Tensions**: Competing interests, unresolved debates, risk factors with evidence
- **Impact Vector**: Measurable business/policy implications, case studies, strategic outcomes

**Phase 3: Intelligence Standards**
- Prioritize primary sources and recent authoritative data
- Include specific KPIs, percentages, and concrete examples with dates
- Explicitly flag conflicting information: "Sources disagree on..." or "Data suggests competing interpretations..."
- Distinguish between established facts vs emerging trends vs speculation

**Phase 4: Strategic Resources**
5-7 high-value intelligence sources:
- Recent primary research (studies, reports, white papers)
- Authoritative market/policy analysis with specific credentials
- Key datasets or analytical frameworks
- Contrarian perspectives from credible sources
- Real-time tracking tools or dashboards

**Phase 5: Executive Intelligence Brief**
5-6 strategic insights answering "What should decision-makers do with this information?"
- Immediate opportunities/risks with timeframes
- Competitive implications and positioning considerations  
- Resource allocation or strategic pivot recommendations
- Key metrics to monitor going forward

**Quality Standards:**
- Distinguish strategic insights (affect competitive position/resource allocation) from tactical information
- Use confidence indicators: "High confidence based on multiple sources" vs "Emerging pattern requiring monitoring"
- Target insights that enable specific decisions, not just awareness
